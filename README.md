# My_saves
 Repo to support cloud saves when official support is not possible.

This repo syncs two folder saves, based on the last modified file on each one. 
You need to specify the path where your save games exist and where you want to put it.
If you choose a cloud service-sync folder (like a Google Drive or Onedrive), this will sync
authomatically with other computers.

If you install this repo on other computers with the same folder, you can keep synched all savegames
using just one command before and after a game is launched.
